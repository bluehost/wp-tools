DESCRIPTION

    WordPress Tools is a set of tools that allow you to backup, restore,
    and upgrade WordPress sites. The tools are especially useful for
    upgrading very outdated sites and for scripting the backing up and
    upgrading of many sites.

    WordPress Tools was built to make the Internet more secure. A huge
    number of websites on the Internet use WordPress
    <https://wordpress.org/>, because it's awesome, but a large portion of
    those sites do not run the latest version of WordPress which makes them
    susceptible to hacking. WordPress Tools can be used to get those sites
    up-to-date again, and that makes the whole Internet more secure.

    The code has been used in production and has already upgraded over two
    million WordPress sites, but it has little real-world testing outside
    of Linux at this point so your mileage may vary if you have a different
    operating system. Stay tuned as we add support for more platforms, and
    please contribute if you feel like it.

    The command-line program also has a lot of options for managing server
    load, so you can upgrade your sites without killing your server.

INSTALLATION

    There are several ways to install WordPress Tools to your system.

    Make sure you have WP-CLI <http://wp-cli.org/> and the other
    "DEPENDENCIES" installed.

 Using cpanm

    The easiest way to install WordPress Tools is using cpanm. If you have
    a local perl (plenv, perlbrew, etc.), you can just do:

        cpanm App::WordPressTools

    to install the wp-tools executable and its dependencies. The executable
    will be installed to your perl's bin path, like
    ~/perl5/perlbrew/bin/wp-tools.

    If you're installing to your system perl, you can do:

        cpanm --sudo App::WordPressTools

    to install the wp-tools executable to a system directory, like
    /usr/local/bin/wp-tools (depending on your perl).

 Downloading just the executable

    If you want to handle the Perl dependencies yourself and just want the
    wp-tools executable, you can do:

        curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluehost/wp-tools/solo/wp-tools
        chmod +x wp-tools

    to download the wp-tools executable to your current directory.

 For developers

    If you're a developer and want to hack on the source, clone the
    repository and pull the dependencies:

        git clone https://github.com/bluehost/wp-tools.git
        cd wp-tools
        cpanm Dist::Zilla
        dzil authordeps --missing | cpanm
        dzil listdeps --author --develop --missing | cpanm

DEPENDENCIES

    WordPress Tools requires these other programs and libraries in order to
    do its work. You probably have most of these on your system already,
    and the cpanm method of installing wp-tools will handle the Perl module
    dependencies for you.

      * WP-CLI <http://wp-cli.org/>

      * GNU Coreutils <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>

      * GNU Tar <https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/>

      * awk

      * grep

      * mysql (MySQL server client)

      * procps

      * Various Perl modules (see the distributed cpanfile file for a list)

OPTIONS

    --help

      Show usage information and exit.

    --force

      If there are any resource limits in effect, ignore them and do the
      command anyway.

    --max-count=num

      Delete the oldest backups, keeping the number provided (default: 5).

    --max-dproc=num

      Refuse to execute if the maximum number of defunct processes on the
      system exceeds this number (default: 100).

    --max-load=num

      Refuse to execute if the load average exceeds this number (default:
      200).

    --max-size=num

      Refuse to back up a site if its uncompressed size on disk exceeds
      this number of bytes (default: 5368709120).

    --max-run=num

      Do not allow more than this number of concurrent system-wide
      executions of the script (default: 50).

    --min-freemem=num

      Refuse to execute if free memory has dropped below this number of
      bytes (default: 1048576).

    --wp-cli=path

      If your wp-cli program has a different name than wp or is not in your
      $PATH, you can specify the command to be used to call wp-cli.

    --username=name

      If you run wp-tools as a root user, it will drop permissions to the
      specified user and chdir to their home directory.

COMMANDS

    upgrade

      The upgrade command will upgrade your WordPress core, themes, and
      plugins to the latest version available. It takes a full backup prior
      to the update. After the update, wp-tools will do a quick check to
      try to determine that nothing broke on your site. If any failures are
      detected, wp-tools will automatically restore to the backup taken
      prior to update.

    backup

      The backup command will create a full backup, including database, of
      your WordPress installation as long as it is under the --max-size
      limit (pre-compression).

    restore

      The restore command will restore a WordPress installation from a
      backup taken using the backup command.

EXAMPLES

        # upgrade a site
        wp-tools upgrade --path=public_html/myblog \
                         --backupdir=myblog_backups
    
        # upgrade only plugins and themes
        wp-tools upgrade --path=public_html/myblog  \
                         --backupdir=myblog_backups \
                         --components=plugin,theme
    
        # backup a site
        wp-tools backup --path=public_html/mysite \
                        --backupdir=backups/mysite
    
        # restore a site to a previous state
        wp-tools restore --backupfile=backups/mysite/wp_backup1428524082.tar.gz

BUGS

    Currently, wp-tools tries very hard to run with your $HOME as the
    current working directory. It will chdir there before executing its
    command, and it does NOT translate relative paths. This means that if
    you run wp-tools from outside of your home directory with a relative
    path, your paths won't be found. This is a temporary limitation that
    will be fixed soon.
